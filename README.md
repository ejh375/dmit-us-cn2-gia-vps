DMIT just restocked two of their value-packed US CN2 GIA VPS plans: PalmSpring and Irvine locations. Both come with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The IPv4 routes through three-network CN2 GIA lines, while IPv6 gets CMIN2 optimization. 

The base config gives you 2 cores, 2GB RAM, 40GB storage, 2TB monthly traffic, and 2Gbps bandwidth—all for $100 per year. Pretty straightforward for anyone running personal websites or small projects that need dependable connectivity back to China.

## What's Actually In Stock

DMIT brought back their LAX.Pro series with two specific locations. These aren't flashy new products—just solid performers that people kept asking about.

**PVM.LAX.Pro.PalmSpring**
- 2 vCPU cores
- 2GB RAM
- 40GB SSD storage
- 2TB monthly traffic
- 2Gbps bandwidth
- IPv4: Three-network CN2 GIA
- IPv6: CMIN2 optimized
- $100/year

**PVM.LAX.Pro.Irvine**
- Same specs as PalmSpring
- Different physical location
- $100/year

One thing worth noting: if you blow through your monthly traffic allowance, they don't shut you down. Instead, they throttle you to 4Mbps and let you keep going unlimited. Not ideal, but better than getting cut off entirely.

So here's the thing about CN2 GIA routing—it's basically the express lane for traffic between the US and China. Regular routes can get congested during peak hours, especially evenings in China. CN2 GIA sidesteps a lot of that mess with dedicated bandwidth and shorter hops. For sites targeting Chinese visitors or anyone needing stable cross-border connectivity, it makes a real difference in load times and reliability.

The IPv6 setup uses CMIN2, which is China Mobile's international network. Not quite as premium as CN2 GIA, but still optimized for China-bound traffic and often less crowded than regular routes.

## Testing The Waters

Before you commit, DMIT provides test IPs for their different network tiers. Worth pinging these from your actual location to see real-world latency:

**Premium Networks:**
- Hong Kong Premium (PVM.HKG.Pro): 103.117.100.20
- US Premium (PVM.LAX.Pro): 154.17.29.71  
- Japan Premium (PVM.TYO.Pro): 45.88.193.23

**Standard Networks:**
- Hong Kong Standard (PVM.HKG.Lite): 103.135.248.201
- US Standard (PVM.SJC): 174.136.205.8
- Japan Standard (PVM.TYO.Lite): 154.31.112.1

The Premium tier (which includes these restocked plans) consistently shows better routing and lower packet loss to China compared to Standard. If you're mainly serving Chinese users, that premium routing actually matters.

People who've tested the LAX.Pro series generally report sub-200ms latency to major Chinese cities during off-peak hours. Not amazing, but workable for most web applications. Peak hours can push higher, but the dedicated CN2 GIA paths keep things more stable than budget alternatives.

The 2Gbps bandwidth sounds excessive for most personal sites, but it's really about burst capacity. Your site can handle traffic spikes without choking, then settle back to normal usage. The 2TB monthly allocation works out to roughly 6Mbps sustained if you maxed it 24/7—plenty of headroom for typical blog or small business traffic patterns.

For $100 yearly, you're looking at about $8.33 monthly. Compare that to similar CN2 GIA offerings that often run $15-20/month for comparable specs. The catch is availability—these plans sell out regularly because the pricing actually makes sense.

## Bottom Line

DMIT's restocked LAX.Pro plans offer solid value if you need CN2 GIA routing to China. The $100/year price point, combined with 2TB traffic and 2Gbps bandwidth, covers most personal website needs without requiring you to think too hard about resource limits. IPv4 gets you the premium three-network CN2 GIA routing, while IPv6 adds CMIN2 optimization as a bonus.
